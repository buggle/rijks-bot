Many museums, libraries and collections have made their data available to the public via APIs. API's are great because they package content neatly so that we can play around with it. The biggest question really is what you want to build using all this free data. For this tutorial I'll look into how I can build a twitter bot that tweets images from the wonderful Rijksmuseum collection in Amsterdam. The tutorial will include how to build a small ruby program that interacts with the museum API using search words of your choice, how to create a small bot interface and how to deploy to heroku to make it go live. The tutorial is suitable for anyone with a little bit of familiarity with ruby, and with a basic command of a text editor and the terminal.
